# Predicting-Iris-Species
A machie learning project for classifying Iris flower species(setosa,versicolor,virginica) using python and scikit-learn.This project involves data visualization,pre processing and model and training and evaluation to accurately predict the flower species based on sepal and petal measurement.
Dataset Information
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
